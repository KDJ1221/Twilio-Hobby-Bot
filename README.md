## About

A lot of people are really bored during quarantine and are running ideas of what to do! Therefore I came up with the idea of creating an SMS chatbot that people could text and get a random hobby idea back. It was hard to google the wording for such an API, so I did some digging online and found a txt file containing over 600 random hobbies.

I also added a random dog generator using the [dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) given [the tutorial I was following](https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-a-sms-chatbot-with-python-flask-and-twilio) generated random photos of cats, but lately photos of dogs have been helping me during this time so I thought they'd be nice for someone else too!
